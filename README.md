# Business Intelligence Visualization for StartSafe

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) analysis for StartSafe, a platform supporting organizations in conducting routine safety and quality inspections. The project utilizes Python and its robust data analysis libraries to process and visualize key insights from StartSafe's operational datasets, helping to identify inefficiencies and enhance performance.

## Features

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
•	Addressed missing values using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.

•	Standardized column names for better clarity and usability.

•	Removed irrelevant or incomplete data to ensure accurate analysis.

### Advanced Data Analysis:
•	Trend analysis to uncover temporal patterns.

•	Correlation and clustering techniques to identify relationships between variables.

•	Comparative performance evaluation of operators based on task completion rates and efficiency.

### Insights Extraction:
•	Operational inconsistencies identified in environmental metrics, user performance, and inspection outcomes.

•	Highlighted correlations between inspection conditions and outcomes to inform decision-making.

•	Revealed workload imbalances and opportunities for optimization in user performance.
